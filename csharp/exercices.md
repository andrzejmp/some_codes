# Exercices in C#

### Ex. 01
Write a function in C# that:
1.  takes three int parameters (an amount of random numbers, the left edge and the right edge of the range)
2.  generates these randem numbers
3.  returns the average of those numbers
4.  test this function in the program

### Ex. 02
Write a function in C# that: 
1.  takes three double parameters (lengths of a trianle sides)
2.  checks if there exists a triangle with such sides
3.  returns the area of the triangle (if exits) or 0 if do not exist
4.  test this function in the program

### Ex. 03
Write a C# function that sorts an array of integer numbers using Bubble sort.
1. the function should take as a parameter an unsorted array and return the sorted array
2.  test this function in the program


### Ex. 04
Write a program that generates and prints out such pattern:

    ....0....
    ...1.2...
    ..3.4.5..
    .6.7.8.9.

### Ex. 05
Write a program that generates n first Fibonacci numbers.
(Both, iteration and recursion versions).

### Ex. 06
Write a program that calculates number of prime numbers in a given range from 2 to 10000.

### Ex. 07
Write a class that represents an employee.
The class should have such members:

    name
    hourly rate
    constructor
    method that returns salary depending on the amount of hours of work

In the program create two objects (workers) and test the class.
